This application enables adding, reading, updating and deleting messages.

##### Terminology
Terminology explanation:
* **JavaScript**: is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages or to implement web applications.
* **GUI HTML**: it's an abbreviation for Graphical User Interface. It enables user to interact with application. GUI HTML means that user interacts with application via html web page.
* **Express framework**: Express.js is the most popular web framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs and has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
* **Ejs**: Ejs is template engine that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. In other words it generates HTML pages on server side so you can fill this page with data on server side instead of client side.

##### Flow
The following flow takes place in this project:
1. User via any html browser sends request to application with specific CRUD action: Create, Read, Update or Delete.
1. Application performs specific CRUD action.
1. Application sends back response to user via html browser with page. This page is different and depends on specific CRUD action.
